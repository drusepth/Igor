=Igor=

==Description==
Igor is a voice-activated assistant in the same category as Siri and Google 
Assistant, except it's built as a web app on top of HTML5's x-webkit-speech
feature.

==Integrations==
To make adding functionality as easy as possible, all 3rd-party functionality
is provided in the form of integrations, which are separate scripts that sit
in the integrations folder and are injected only if a user tries to use them.
